A smartphone app (implemented as Progressive Web Application - PWA) to scan [IGSN](https://www.igsn.org/)
QR codes and show related information (related datasets, funding, people).

The app can be installed by visiting the PWA homepage: https://dataportals.pangaea.de/freya/igsn/

After that a popup should appear in the browser which allows to install it locally. To use it
it has to be given camera access. The app can be installed on Android and iOS, but should also run
in every modern browser.

This app was developed with funding by the European Unionâ€™s Horizon 2020
research and innovation programme under grant agreement
No [777523](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/777523).
